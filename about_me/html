    <h3>(Jack)</h3>
    <p>Hello! My name is Lincoln Allen, or Jack, I am 19 years old. I live in Liberty, Missouri, USA. Right now i am working for Hallmark cards at their Liberty Distribution Center. I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree in computer science. The reason for this is because computer science is a good skill to have in these days and beyond.</p>
    <p>I was born in the convenant by two loving parents. I have one brother serving a mission and two sisters in 10th grade and 7th grade respectivley. I am single. I do not have a favorite quote from a leader of the church. My favorite scripture would be Helaman Chapter 5.</p>
