      <h3>Equipment</h3>
      <p>
        Items Can be divided into three sections: Evidence, Protection, and Miscellaneous. Evidence items are items that directly correspond to an evidence that the ghosts can have.

        Evidence Items:
        EMF Reader: Detects electromagnetic signals when the ghost interacts with the environment, indicating its presence. Every ghost can set off the EMF reader but only ghosts with EMF 5 evidences can make all 5 lights go off.
        Spirit Box: Allows players to communicate with ghosts by asking questions. Only Ghosts with the Spirit Box evidence can respond to the player.
        Thermometer: Measures room temperatures and helps identify areas where paranormal activity may occur. Ghosts without the freezing temperatures evidence will lower the temperature to about three degrees celcius.
        UV Light: Reveals fingerprints and handprints left by ghosts and otherworldly entities after interacting with the environment. Only Ghosts with the Ultraviolet evidence type will leave fingerprints.
        Ghost Writing Book: A journal for capturing written messages or drawings from the ghost. Ghosts without the ghost writing evidence cannot interact with the book.
        Video Camera: Can be placed wherever the player wants to project the events the camera sees into the truck outside the house. If a ghost has Ghost Orbs as an evidence, or the ghost is The Mimic, small glowing orbs will show up on the video feed.
        D.O.T.S. Projector: A projector that shines light to illuminate ghosts. When ghosts have the D.O.T.S evidence an outline of the ghost can be seen in the projection radius.
        
        Other Items:
        Flashlight: Provides light in dark areas to help players see and identify ghostly activity.
        Photo Camera: Captures images of ghosts or ghost interactions. Capturing pictures of the ghost or paranormal activity can net you extra money when completing the mission.
        Salt: Can be placed for the ghost to step in giving the opportunity for pictures.
        Candle: Provides a small amount of light and can be used to prevent sanity from draining..
        Motion Sensor: Detects movement in the area, helping identify ghostly activity.
        Parabolic Microphone: Amplifies and captures distant sounds, aiding in pinpointing ghostly noises.
        Sound Sensor: Monitors and registers audio disturbances caused by the ghost.
        Glowstick: Creates a light source and can display fingerprints during investigations.
        Head-Mounted Camera: Records a first-person view of the player's perspective during the investigation.

        Protection Items:
        Crucifix: Acts as a protective item to prevent the ghost from attacking in a certain radius.
        Smudge Sticks: Used to cleanse an area and temporarily prevent the ghost from hunting.
        Sanity Pills: Restores a decent amount of the players sanity.

      <h3>Ghosts</h3>
      <p>
        
        Every ghost has 3 identifying evidence that the player can find. Primary evidence as it's called can be given by the 7 evidence items if they are apllicable. Ghosts can also be identified by secondary evidence which is based around behavior rather than evidence items.
